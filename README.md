- Microsoft does not provide official support for this sample
- Users are responsible for testing and validating the code in their own environments
- Always follow your organization's security and compliance policies when handling PII data
- Ensure proper data governance and privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) when processing personal information

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Azure subscription with:
  - Azure Storage Account
  - Azure AI Foundry Language Service resource (with PII redaction preview features enabled)

## Quick Setup

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pii-redact-doc-blazor-sample
dotnet restore
```

### 2. Configure Azure Credentials

```bash
# Set your Azure Storage connection string
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:AzureStorage" "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=YOUR_ACCOUNT;AccountKey=YOUR_KEY;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"

# Set your Azure AI Language service credentials
dotnet user-secrets set "Azure:LanguageKey" "YOUR_API_KEY"
dotnet user-secrets set "Azure:LanguageEndpoint" "https://YOUR_RESOURCE.cognitiveservices.azure.com"
dotnet user-secrets set "Azure:ApiVersion" "2024-11-15-preview"
```

### 3. Create Storage Containers

Create these containers in your Azure storage account:

- `piisource` - for uploaded PDF documents
- `piitarget` - for redacted PDF documents

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5186`

## Usage

1. Upload a PDF document
2. Click "Process Document" to start PII detection
3. Monitor processing status
4. View and download redacted results

## Features

- PDF upload with drag-and-drop interface
- Real-time processing with progress tracking
- Native document PII detection and redaction
- Download both JSON results and redacted PDF documents
- Secure Azure integration with SAS URLs
